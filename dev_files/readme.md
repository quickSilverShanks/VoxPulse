## Data Preparation

Key observations from data:
- The original source has 37 files pertaining to reviews for different product categories and is 54.41 GB in total.
- Removing rows with no votes and skipping bad lines in raw data leaves us with ~42% of the rows that can be used.
- In usable data, there are product categories with as low as 7000 reviews; a total of 6 categories have less than 200,000 reviews; 18 categories have more than 1 mil. reviews. Based on this alone, 200,000 seems like a good value for confidence weight, `m`.

To generate the train-val-test an other required splits datasets below has been taken care of:
- Considering the size of data, it should first be explored in Kaggle itself, downloading only necessary data of much smaller size (10.7 GB zipped).
- Reviews with no user vote is not worth considering.
- The model must be able to predict helpfulness of products it hasn't seen in training. So, 4(2+2) product categories with good range of usefulness in the data must be kept separately for validation(2) and test(2) purposes only. This will allow us to have in-sample and out-of-sample validation/test scores.
- Keep only necessary columns: "product_category", "product_title", "product_parent", "review_headline", "review_body", "review_date", "star_rating", "total_votes", "helpful_votes", "verified_purchase", "vine".
- **[IMPORTANT]** Only 6 categories have less than 200,000 reviews and one has only 7000 reviews. From these 6 categories, a fixed percent of data must be kept aside for validation.
- To do a mockup of new inbound data in MLOps pipeline, separate certain percentage of data from 5 categories with >1mil. rows and 4 categories with 0.2-1mil. rows. This can be used to test multiple iterations of MLOps functionality from data ingestion to new champion model deployment.
