## What is Voxpulse?

"**Vox**" (Latin for voice) + "**Pulse**" (capturing the heartbeat of customer opinions)

VoxPulse is an AI-powered review-ranking engine that listens to the voice of the customer and identifies the most helpful, balanced, and informative opinions.



## üéØ What it does?

Using intelligent scoring that factors in clarity, specificity, sentiment/tone balance, credibility, and engagement cues (e.g., upvotes or verified status if available), VoxPulse brings the most valuable feedback to the forefront. This empowers users to make smarter decisions and enables businesses to quickly spot high-signal feedback for product improvements.

üîÑ Potential Downstream Applications
- **Review Summarization**: Generate concise summaries using only the most insightful and trustworthy reviews.
- **Customer Support Insights**: Surface recurring complaints or suggestions from high-quality feedback.
- **Product Benchmarking**: Compare usefulness trends across competing products or categories.
- **E-Commerce Ranking Signals**: Integrate usefulness scores into search/sort algorithms on product pages.
- **User Trust Systems**: Prioritize showing reviews that are likely to influence purchasing decisions.
- **Marketing Feedback Loops**: Identify language and themes in helpful reviews to inform messaging.
- **Quality Control**: Flag low-quality or misleading reviews for moderation or de-prioritization.
- **Feature Roadmap Planning**: Detect high-value suggestions from helpful review patterns.
- **Voice-of-Customer Dashboards**: Feed structured, trustworthy review insights into analytics tools.



## üßÆ Quantifying a Reliable Usefulness Score

### The Dilemma
When predicting the usefulness of a review, a common metric is the ratio of helpful votes to total votes:
> usefulness_ratio = helpful_votes / total_votes

However, this ratio alone can be misleading. For example:
- A review with 1 helpful vote out of 1 total vote yields a 100% ratio
- Another with 10 helpful votes out of 11 yields ~91%

Despite the lower ratio, the second review is likely more genuinely helpful, as it's backed by more community feedback. This presents a **credibility vs. ratio dilemma**:
> How do we reward both high ratios and high engagement?

### The Solution: Bayesian Adjusted Usefulness
To address this, we use a **Bayesian smoothing technique** ‚Äî <u>commonly applied in rating systems like IMDB</u> ‚Äî to combine the observed ratio with a prior belief, weighted by vote count.

Formula:
```python
adjusted_usefulness = (helpful_votes + m * prior) / (total_votes + m)
```
- `helpful_votes`: Number of helpful votes
- `total_votes`: Total votes received
- `prior`: Average usefulness across all reviews
- `m`: Confidence weight (number of votes needed before we "trust" the ratio)

**Example**:

Let‚Äôs assume:
- `prior = 0.6` (average helpfulness in dataset)
- `m = 5`

Then:
- Review A (1/1):
<br>  `adjusted = (1 + 5*0.6) / (1 + 5) = 4 / 6 ‚âà 0.667`
- Review B (10/11):
<br>  `adjusted = (10 + 5*0.6) / (11 + 5) = 13 / 16 ‚âà 0.812`

This method rightly gives more weight to Review B due to stronger support.

### ‚úÖ Benefits
The above methodology helps us create a more reliable target for training regression or ranking models.
- Smooths out inflated scores from low-vote reviews
- Reflects confidence in the usefulness estimate
- Prevents usefulness score from swinging a lot on addition of every new vote
