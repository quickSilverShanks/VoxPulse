## What is Voxpulse?

"**Vox**" (Latin for voice) + "**Pulse**" (capturing the heartbeat of customer opinions)

VoxPulse is an AI-powered review-ranking engine that listens to the voice of the customer and identifies the most helpful, balanced, and informative opinions.



## What it does?

Using intelligent scoring that factors in clarity, specificity, sentiment/tone balance, credibility, and engagement cues (e.g., upvotes or verified status if available), VoxPulse brings the most valuable feedback to the forefront. This empowers users to make smarter decisions and enables businesses to quickly spot high-signal feedback for product improvements.
